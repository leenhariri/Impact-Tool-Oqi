# Fix Docker Authentication Issue - TODO

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] 1. Update docker-compose.yml CORS configuration
- [x] 2. Fix cookie settings for Docker environment
- [x] 3. Verify frontend configuration
- [ ] 4. Test authentication flow
- [ ] 5. Rebuild and restart containers
- [ ] 6. Verify login works from frontend

## Progress:
- [x] Analysis completed - identified Docker network/CORS issue
- [x] Plan approved by user
- [x] Updated docker-compose.yml with NODE_ENV=development
- [x] Verified cookie settings are correct for Docker environment
- [x] Confirmed frontend configuration is correct

## Changes Made:
1. **docker-compose.yml**: Added `NODE_ENV: development` to ensure proper cookie settings
2. **Cookie Configuration**: Verified that cookies are set with:
   - `httpOnly: true` (security)
   - `secure: false` (for development)
   - `sameSite: "lax"` (for development)
   - `domain: undefined` (allows localhost)

## Next Steps:
- Rebuild containers with: `docker compose down && docker compose up --build`
- Test login from frontend at http://localhost:3000
